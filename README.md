# Coursera - Developers Guide to Node-RED

## Start the [A Developer's Guide to Node-RED](https://www.coursera.org/learn/developer-nodered) Course

Node-RED is a flow-based programming environment from the JS Foundation. It provides a palette of nodes that allow users to very quickly wire up IoT applications that can combine streams of both physical and digital events. Its Node.JS runtime is easy to install on both devices and the cloud, and provides a framework for extending its capabilities.
 
In this [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/developer-nodered), learners will be introduced to many of Node-RED's core features, learn how to create dashboards for their data, access external systems and create new nodes for the palette. Once they have completed the course, they will be able to leverage the full power of Node-RED to continue their IoT development experience.

The Node-RED Dashboard chapter is split into four Lectures
* Lecture 1 - [Node-RED Dashboard Introduction](Dashboard/Lecture1-Node-RED-Dashboard-Intro/README.md)
* Lecture 2 - [Node-RED Dashboard Layout](Dashboard/Lecture2-Node-RED-Layout-Config/README.md)
* Lecture 3 - [Node-RED Dashboard Charts](Dashboard/Lecture3-Node-RED-Charts/README.md)
* Lecture 4 - [Node-RED Dashboard Forms and Templates](Dashboard/Lecture4-Node-RED-Dashboard-FormsTemplate/README.md)
